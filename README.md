# TypeScript Learning Playground

 A repository for practicing and learning **TypeScript**.

This is where I collect small code examples, exercises, and experiments as I work through learning both the basics and advanced features of TypeScript.

##  Project Structure

- `src/` — TypeScript source files
- `dist/` — Compiled JavaScript output (generated automatically)
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration
- `.gitignore` — Excluded files like `node_modules/`
